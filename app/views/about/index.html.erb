      <h3>The Three Pillars</h3>
      <p class="about_model_p">
        <strong>Thought Leaders:</strong> Our ties to education's thought leaders inform
        our methods. Thought leaders clarify <u>what</u> research tells us.
        We translate the "what" into the operational "how" because this is the dilemma
        most schools, given their unique circumstances, ultimately grapple with.
      </p>
      <p class="about_model_p">
        <strong>Precision Advisers:</strong> We are an exclusive team of accomplished education leaders. We know what research says and how schools work.
        We understand local circumstances and what state standards expect of our schools. <em>Precision</em> is a network of professionals who are collectively armed with the
        know-how related to the critical issues facing our schools.
      </p>
      <p class="about_model_p">
        <strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> Our technical infrastructure integrates our research-based methods.
        This is as it should be. Many schools today rely on a buffet of disparate tools, which do little to harmonize the whole.
        Our tools feed our community-wide knowledge base of operational metrics, making data-driven collaboration possible.
        Our knowledge base also sustains our relationships with thought leaders.
