        <p style="line-height:1.8em"> We are a network of seasoned educators. We collaborate with education's thought leaders
            and work with schools to apply research-based methods to their local circumstances.&nbsp;
            We build "community" among our schools who, using common methods and integrated tools,
            help each other move along the path of continuous performance improvement.

            <em>Precision's</em> seasoned advisers measure school performance relative to any research-based framework,
            such as <em>Colorado's Standards and Indicators for Continuous School Improvement</em>.
            Our methodology ensures this is done with precision and consistency.
            Our tools organize all diagnostic findings and supporting evidences,
            and automatically relates them to the relevant strands/indicators of the standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            All diagnostic data are kept on-line as a baseline from which schools can analyze their future progress against established standards.

          <p>
            Our planning methodology involves a <em>Precision</em> adviser collaborating with
            the school's leadership team. Diagnostic findings are reviewed and weighed: they are understood in relation to one another and in context of
            the school's particular circumstances.
            The resulting <em>Action Plan</em> illuminates up to three achievable goals, which are owned by the leadership team.
            These goals do not represent a finish line: they are immediate steps which, when successfully achieved, will reveal the next steps of an ongoing performance improvement process.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Precision</em> connects schools having achieved, or are striving to achieve, similar goals.

          <p>We shepherd the schools of our community toward their goals. We are able to do this efficiently
            because of the credibility <em>Precision's</em> local advisers earn with school leaders;
            and because <em>Precision's</em> infrastructure enables our team to observe, in confidence and without intrusion, how our schools are progressing.
          </p>
          <p>Periodic diagnostic checkpoints produce objective indicators of progress for each school and that of the community as a whole. This, in turn,
            helps our research partners better understand what our schools need from them.

              Mis-alignment between IT spending and what is needed for each school to fundamentally improve its performance is a serious root problem. This is why our integrated toolkit and our technology credentials are keys to <em>Precision's</em> approach.
